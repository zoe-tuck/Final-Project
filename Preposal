# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Ideas:
    1. Charlie the Steak copycat game or a similar game - this is essentially one of those games where you beat up an NPC, the fun
    part about Charle the Steak is that it has extensive lore and was considered "Lost Media" for years after it was taken off app stores.
    2. If my original idea may be unattainable then I can turn the idea into a html page with all the information surronding the hidden history of 
    lost games like charlie the steak. This way I'll still be on a specific track for whichever choice I choose. 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

As of right now I don't have any plans to collaborate with a classmate, but I am open to the idea. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

After submitting the pre-proposal or proposal, would I be able to make a major change to my project? Or would I need another approval?

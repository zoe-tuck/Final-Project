This project is titled "The Lost Media Archive" (TLMA)
Created by: Zoe Tucker, Temple University 2028

TLMA is a small-scale web thriller/mystery game loosely based on the indie game "Welcome to the Game"

Although unfinished, I had fun with the web design and creating this project. The greatest difficulty I faced was overcoming a learning 
curve with JavaScript and CSS, I overcame this by using multiple sources to aid in the website's design, such as teleporthq.io. Another issue 
I currently face making the user input have a specific outcome on the actual site, my still-growing Java skills may be the reason.

However, I enjoyed creating something that will show those who do play TLMA some of my interests: aka old & niche video games

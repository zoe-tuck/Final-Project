# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

A prospective name for my project could be "Escape the Page"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is a website that enters you into a mystery game about lost media such as Charlie the Steak.
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In more depth, this project will be a html-based website with multiple pages that lead the user along a path of discovery and horror 
about disturbing lost media. The goal of this game is to uncover the truth about a Reddit-famous game that was taken off of App stores 
years ago that hardly anyone remebers. It will be created in an analog horror theme, as users navigate the pages, they must find clues that allow
them to continue to the next page. TextEdit for Mac software will be used to create the html file/website. The site will feature mostly text, 
images, inputs/outputs, and buttons

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will accomplish creating a website that has varying subpages and content.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project however would be to create a good, intriguing storyline that contributes to the website/games atmosphere.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project would be to have an intriguing storyline, thrill elements, and maybe animations/sound effects to 
really make the project stand out. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps would be to do more research on creating html pages and on lost media, specifically old video games. I will need to aquire more
story telling skills as creating analog horror is its own process. Using research around what makes media 'lost' will better suit me in creating
my own plot line. I will probably also need to find reference games/videos on similar site-based games and/or plots. I'll also need to become more 
comfortable with HTML editors, but I believe I can just use VS Code.
